# About Me:
I am a recently graduated biomedical engineer, looking for challenging roles in engineering and eager to further my knowledge in different areas, such as data analytics and operations management.

First and foremost, I love to learn, and I'm pretty good at it. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to gain knowledge in a lot of different fields, such as mechanical engineering, mechatronics engineering, and biomedical science. All of this has provided me with broad proficiency in both engineering tools and software, as well as the bonus of being able to apply these tools to solve medical problems. Thus, I know CAD software, movement analysis software, some programming languages, and research/development, along with basic computer skills such as Microsoft Office. I am currently learning about Data Analytics, and by summer 2021, I'm hoping to be proficient in database analysis, data visualization, along with all the tools needed for this.

Alongside this, I pride myself on having a multidisciplinary scope. I have work experience in production and operative areas in a company and have international experience in the United States, Italy, and China. I also have studied and applied marketing and social media management, and have done ample volunteer work for causes I believe in, such as climate change and social issues. All of this has allowed me to sensitize myself to working with all kinds of people, developing tolerance, empathy, and leadership, as well as the confidence to carry myself in a work environment.

I am excited to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in engineering, data analysis, or management roles.
